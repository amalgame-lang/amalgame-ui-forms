/*
 * facade-stub.h — empty runtime header for the Forms facade.
 *
 * The package's API is implemented in `facade.am` (pure Amalgame
 * on top of amalgame-ui-sdl); this file exists only because the
 * manifest's `[stdlib].header` field is currently required by
 * PackageRegistry.LoadFrom in amc. The user binary's #include of
 * this header is a no-op.
